# Programming-Languages-1
This repository contains the code used for my first assignment on the elective course Programming Languages. The project involves the implementation of Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and K-Nearest Regressor algorithms and the calculation of performance metrics MSE, R2, MAE and MAPE for evaluating the dataset "Coal Fired Plant Dataset".
